# Welcome to wveib 🚀

This is the home of projects built purely on **vibes**—spontaneous ideas coded into existence using Cursor, v0, or just raw impulse. No rigid plans, no unnecessary complexity—just fun, fast, and sometimes absurd builds.

## What's Inside 🛠️
- **Quick prototypes** – Ideas that felt cool at the time
- **Automation & AI** – Because why not let machines do the work?
- **Unconventional solutions** – Creative? Questionable? Both?
- **Minimal maintenance** – These projects exist as they are

## Why? 🤷‍♂️
Because sometimes, you just have to code something for the sake of it. Some projects might evolve, others might remain as experiments, but all of them reflect the joy of building without overthinking.
